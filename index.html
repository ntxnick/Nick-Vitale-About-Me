				<h2>Beyond the Screen</h2>
				<p>
					I earned my degree in Computer Science from the University of Texas at Dallas, driven by a natural curiosity and a passion for hands-on problem-solving. I’ve always been fascinated by how things work — whether it’s hardware, software, or anything in between.
				</p>
				<p>
					Outside of my professional work, I’ve applied this mindset to a variety of personal projects. These include building my own desktop PC, assembling a custom mechanical keyboard, constructing a functional watch, and even dismantling my car’s dashboard to upgrade its lighting system from traditional bulbs to modern LEDs.				
				</p>
				<p>
					These projects reflect not just a technical skill set, but a genuine enjoyment of tinkering, building, and improving systems. A mindset I bring to every challenge I take on.

				<h2>Outside of Work</h2>
				<p>
					Outside of the office, work-life balance is important. Stamps fill a passport from Italy, Aruba, London, and Edinburgh, with future trips to Paris or Japan. Relaxation comes from watching TV, playing video games, and cooking. My signature dish is a simple pasta Aglio e Olio.

			<h2 class="text-pad">The Making Of This Site</h2>
			<p class="text-pad">This website is hosted using GitHub Pages, a static site hosting service. I chose this platform to showcase foundational front-end development skills, specifically in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.</p>
			<p class="text-pad">One of the challenges I encountered during development was implementing a contact form that could send emails. Since GitHub Pages only supports static content, it lacks the server-side capabilities required to process and send email submissions.</p>
			<p class="text-pad">To work around this limitation, I integrated a third-party service that accepts POST requests and securely forwards the submitted form data to my email. My email address remains protected behind a unique API key. Additionally, I’ve configured domain restrictions so that even if someone inspects the site and attempts to reuse the key elsewhere, the request would be rejected.</p>
			<p class="text-pad">This solution demonstrates not only the use of static site hosting, but also how to securely integrate client-side forms with external APIs.</p>

	<script>
		const form = document.getElementById('contact-form');

		form.addEventListener('submit', async function(event) {
		event.preventDefault();

		const formData = new FormData(form);

		try {
		  const response = await fetch(form.action, {
			method: form.method,
			body: formData,
			headers: {
			  'Accept': 'application/json'
			}
		  });

		  if (response.ok) {
			alert('✅ Message sent successfully!');
			form.reset();
		  } else {
			alert('❌ Oops! Something went wrong.');
		  }
		} catch (error) {
		  alert('❌ Failed to send message. Check your internet or try again later.');
		}
		});
